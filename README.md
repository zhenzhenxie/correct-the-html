# Introduction to Programming Exercise - Correct the HTML

## Overview
In this assignment, you will update the tags inside `index.html`. Think carefully about which HTML element should be used if there is a need to update it. The content inside the tags can help you determine which tag you should use or if it needs to be changed at all. Remember to use semantic HTML tags when updating the document where appropriate. If you make the changes correctly, the page will look the same as it did before any changes were made.

Remember to update the closing tags when changing an element.
